# Quantum Defender - Advanced CSS & JavaScript Game

## Project Overview
Quantum Defender is a visually stunning browser-based game built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without using Canvas API. The game demonstrates advanced front-end development techniques including complex CSS animations, DOM manipulation, particle systems, and game state management.

## Features
- **Advanced CSS Animations**: Complex keyframe animations, gradients, and transitions
- **Particle System**: Visual effects created with pure DOM manipulation
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Physics-based anomaly movement and collision detection
- **Power-ups**: Three unique abilities with cooldown management
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Audio System**: Background music and sound effects with volume control
- **Game State Management**: Comprehensive game loop with pause/resume functionality

## Technical Highlights
1. **No Canvas Used**: All graphics rendered with CSS and DOM elements
2. **Custom Physics Engine**: Vector-based movement and collision detection
3. **Particle Effects System**: Dynamic visual effects using DOM elements
4. **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns across multiple JavaScript classes
5. **Advanced CSS**: Grid layouts, flexbox, CSS variables, and complex animations

## How to Play
1. Click START GAME to begin
2. Click on quantum anomalies to destroy them
3. Drag defense nodes to create barriers that destroy anomalies
4. Use power-ups strategically:
   - SLOW TIME: Slows all anomalies for 5 seconds
   - ENERGY SHIELD: Protects the reactor core for 8 seconds
   - QUANTUM BLAST: Destroys all visible anomalies
5. Protect the reactor core and eliminate all anomalies before time runs out

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main game structure and UI
- `styles.css` - All styling and animations (over 600 lines)
- `game.js` - Core game logic and state management (main game class)
- `particles.js` - Particle effects system
- `audio.js` - Audio management
- `levels.js` - Level configuration and theming

## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced CSS animations and transitions
- Complex DOM manipulation and event handling
- Game development patterns and state management
- Object-oriented JavaScript
- Responsive design principles
- Performance optimization for animations
- Audio API integration
- Modular code architecture

## Browser Compatibility
Tested and working on:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Setup
Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No build process or dependencies required.

## Future Enhancements
Potential additions to expand the project:
1. Additional anomaly types with unique behaviors
2. More power-ups and ability upgrades
3. Boss levels with special mechanics
4. Online leaderboard
5. Level editor
6. Mobile touch optimizations

## Portfolio Value
This project showcases:
- Ability to create complex interactive applications
- Understanding of game development principles
- Expertise in CSS animations and visual effects
- Clean, maintainable code architecture
- Problem-solving skills in implementing game mechanics without Canvas
